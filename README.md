The Kalman filter was first used in the Apollo program to help estimate landing of the lunar module. At that time, only limited telemetry and height information was available, and an accurate estimate of the eventual positioning of the lunar module needed to be calculated from noisy data efficently and quickly.

Since then, the use of the Kalman filter has been wide spread for image processing, target tracking and telemetry estimation. It is a little known but important estimation algorithm, often used in machine learning and other applications. Although there exist Kulman implementations in Python, I have started this project to better understand where Kalman can be applied by learning the math behind it and implementing it myself.
